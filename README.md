###  1- Overview 

The intent for this Application is to provide extra practice in my development skills but more importantly create an simple application to provide people an easy way to track their Job Application process. 

The Jobbs App allows users to create, add, edit and delete Jobs that they may be interested in or have applied to! This is intended to be used by people who in market for a new job and want to organize their job application process. 

This App will allows the user to create a new job they may want to apply to. The user can edit and enter details about this job listing and allows the user to enter details like salary, location and attach a profession and industry to the listing.
